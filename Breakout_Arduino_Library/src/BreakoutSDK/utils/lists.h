/**
 * \file Wharf lists
 *
 * In this file doubly-linked lists implementations for Wharf
 * based on uthash lists http://uthash.sourceforge.net
 *
 * The macros below work for any other list following the model below.
 *
 * !!!Keep in mind that:
 * 1. The xxx type must contain head,tail of the xxx slot type
 * 2. The xxx slot type must contain prev, next the xxx slot type
 * 3. The slot declaration contains struct _xxx_slot where xxx is the name of your list type
 * 4. A macro xxx_free(element, memtype) is defined for a deep free
 * 5. A macro xxx_copy(dest_element, src_element, memtype) is defined for a deep copy
 * 6. A macro xxx_compare(a, b) which should be a logical condition checking if (a <= b) for list ordering purposes
 * 7. A macro xxx_equals(a, b) which should be a logical condition check if (a == b) for remove duplicates purposes
 *
 * List definition examples in the code below.
 *
 *
 *
 *  Doubly-linked lists are largely used due to their flexibility. In most cases, as hash-tables are used, the need to
 *  order data is eliminated. We prefer doubly-linked lists due to their performance in appending, pre-pending and
 *  extracting elements from the front or back. Of course, more memory is used, yet most of the time the benefits are
 *  greater.
 *
 *  Once you'd understand how to quickly design a list, you will appreciate the provided general macros. Use them, they
 *  have been verified in many cases, but also be aware about their implementations and caveats (e.g. combining
 *  WL_FOREACH() with WL_DELETE() won't work as probably expected).
 *
 *  Here are some observations:
 *
 *  - WL_FOREACH() is not safe in case you modify the lists by adding, removing or re-ordering elements. Write your own:
 *  e.g.
 *    for (x = list.head; x; x = next_x) {
 *      next_x = x->next;
 *      ... // Modify here the list, with WL_DELETE for example
 *    }
 *
 *  - WL_FOREACH_SAFE() safe version in case you modify the list by adding or removing elements.
 *
 *  - WL_DUP() is not safe on its own. Many structures that you use this as a copy mechanisms are deep. In case the
 *  macro fails after allocating the slot element, but during the deep copy, you should still call WL_FREE() on it. If
 *  you append this to a list and free all the list, then it is probably safe, but make sure that you do at least one
 *  on the error case. Here is the recommended pattern, but of course thing for yourself if you have something more
 *  complex:
 *  e.g.
 *    list_slot_t *dst = 0;
 *    ...
 *    WL_DUP(dst, src, list_t, mem);
 *    ...
 *    WL_APPEND(list, dst);
 *    dst = 0; // do not forget this in case you add the slot somewhere, to avoid a double free error!
 *    ...
 *  out_of_memory:
 *    ...
 *    WL_FREE(dst, list_t, mem);
 *    ...
 *
 *  - WL_DUP_ALL() should almost always have a WL_FREE_ALL() correspondent on the out_of_memory:, other than, like above
 *  this becomes part of bigger structure and you'd free it all anyway.
 *
 *  - WL_NEW() should be used most of the time (except when it is combined with a WL_DUP() on a sub-element, then see
 *  above for WL_DUP(), in the following pattern, to avoid memory leaks.
 *  e.g.
 *    list_slot_t *x = 0;
 *    ...
 *    WL_NEW(x, list_t, mem);
 *    WL_APPEND(list, x);
 *    x->asdf = x;
 *    ...
 *  out_of_memory:
 *    ...
 *    WL_FREE_ALL(list, list_t, mem);
 *    ...
 *
 *  - WL_SIZE(list, list_type, size)  - calculate list size
 *
 *  - WL_EQUALS(list_type, el1, el2, res) - check if 2 elements are equal - uses xxx_equals(a,b) macro
 *
 *  - WL_REMOVE_DUPLICATES(list, list_type, mem) - removes and frees duplicate elements from a list. Requires the
 *  xxx_equals(a,b) macro
 *
 *
 *  - WL_INSERT_SORT(list, list_type, add) - insert an element in the list, keeping it ordered - O(n) per element, hence
 *  O(n^2) for the full list (use WL_MERGE_SORT() if you have most elements available). The xxx_compare(a,b) macro must
 *  be defined, in order to tell if a<=b.
 *
 *
 *  - WL_MERGE(list_left, list_right, list_dst, list_type) - merge 2 ordered list into  an ordered list. Needs the
 *  xxx_compare(a,b) macro.
 *
 *  - WL_MERGE_SORT(list, list_type) - sort a list with the Merge Sort algorithm - O(nlogn). Needs the xxx_compare(a,b)
 *  macro.
 *
 *  If you find this too intricate, then consider doing your module alternatively in C++.
